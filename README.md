# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust machine learning model that can evaluate credit card applicants' data and make informed predictions regarding their approval likelihood. This model will be trained on historical credit application data, utilizing a wide range of features such as income, income type, employment, education, housing and more. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, I aim to create a accurate and interpretable credit card approval prediction model.

Although not that this is a small dataset and might have it's own limitations.
I have also done some neccesary EDA in the SQL file and some in the jupyter notebook.
