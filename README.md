# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
Here I have created a Machine learning model to predict the likelihood of applicants to approval for a credit card. I have done neccesary pre-processing and feature engineering in the data and made it suitable for building a model.
Although not that this is a small dataset and might have it's own limitations.
I have also done some neccesary EDA in the SQL file and some in the jupyter notebook.
